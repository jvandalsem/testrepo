Mullen set a consistent tone all the way through January for us, and now we alone are basically saving FIJI. Lets do the same for them so they can pick up right where we left off., Oscar Pistorius: Regardless of what night it is we are gonna need lots of bodies there to make it feel intimidating bc there‚Äôs so many of them I hope you all will be there, Sam Rollenhagen: Are they gonna give them a grace period?, Joaquin Guzman: You could hear a pin drop that whole night , Joaquin Guzman: Even when godley said weed is tight no one laughed.... that serious , Oscar Pistorius: Don‚Äôt just do it for our own benefits of them taking it serious so we can get free shit. Do it so that we can be closer as a brotherhood and they can be tight as a pc, Trevor Woods: Let‚Äôs have it be serious as possible , Trevor Woods: No stupid jokes making them say dumb stuff when they introduce themselves , Jon Theros: yeah let‚Äôs me serious as fuck for these guys , Mayor of Titty City: I totally agree if they take pledge term close to as seriously as us they'll be a sick pc, Oscar Pistorius: They‚Äôre still deciding whether it‚Äôs tomorrow or Wednesday I just talked to Ollie , Mayor of Titty City: *tuesday, Will Minck: I'm excited for Wednesday, Joaquin Guzman: Yeah pledge master sunshine set the tone of pledge term as a joke. We can't have that happen , Oscar Pistorius: If anyone disagrees please respond so we can talk this out, Oscar Pistorius: Regarding the new Alpha Eta pc.. in my opinion and it seems like everyone else‚Äôs, these kids are all studs. That being said we need to instill how serious pledge term is. Pledge ed wants to set a very serious tone and they really don‚Äôt want us laughing. We can‚Äôt undermine the pledgemasters at pledge ed especially their first one bc that sets the tone for their entire pledge term. We should be nice to them... to a point. Don‚Äôt go help them out with their pledge tasks and projects more than anyone helped us. Though our pledge term was hard, we are all better people because of it and we owe it to them to give them a similar experience. The zetas kind of got away bc they had only 6 kids, same age as us, and only one real pledge ed but just because we like these new kids doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt set high expectations for them. We had absurd expectations set on us and we got through it, I think they can too , JVD: I agree with this incoming messge^^^, Oscar Pistorius: Alright guys I‚Äôm sorry for the incoming essay but I think it‚Äôs something that needs to be said and before pledge ed on Wednesday Oliver wanted me to pass on a message‚Äî, Adam Branch: It's lit come through , Adam Branch: 6th floor , Mayor of Titty City: Also is anyone in stacks, Mayor of Titty City: Who wants to carpool, Mayor of Titty City: I'm not, Trevor Woods: I am , Adam Branch: Most people are taking the bus to Chicago right , Colton James Cornwell:  +<Image(url='https://i.groupme.com/1000x1000.jpeg.a527c774fcdf48a0a2d3d42b3f8eacf2')>, Colton James Cornwell: It's jonahs if you have , Colton James Cornwell: Has anyone found a phix at the house? , Lucas Fioretti: Yuhhh, Smooky Margielaa: Let‚Äôs ride boys +<Image(url='https://i.groupme.com/844x1500.jpeg.756ed42d4f7b4e0abc50d63b2758b0f5')>, Oscar Pistorius: Someone text him to make sure he‚Äôs like alive lol he hasn‚Äôt responded to anyone in a couple days, Trevor Woods: No, Colton James Cornwell: Was Tyler there last night , Will Minck: Despite the shitstorm yesterday, we still showed the new PC a clown ass night.

I think the best overall options are to either get a pit house or commit a bunch of epsis to living in 707, Ryan Byrd: Judd is now in on the pit. need 3 to 5 more, Ryan Byrd: If we get 14 guys in the pit, rent will be 964/mo each. add utilities and it evens out to $1000/m0 (12k on the year) so roughly the same as the house. That's also a very standard price for rent anywehre in AA, any decent apartment is 1000+/month., Ryan Byrd: ^we should be considering this as you make your housing decision, Ryan Byrd: 707 is probably gonna have roughly 5 epsis, Ryan Byrd: 8 guys are living in zaragon apartments and have already signed, phil is living with the deltas, leaving 15 guys left to figure out their housing. We could get 14, maybe even all 15 in the pit. If we don't do that, I imagine the remaining 15 will pull gammas 2.0 and at least 10 will find apartments. 707 will be left with less than 10 epsis for sure, Ryan Byrd: We need at least 4 more. ideally 6, Ryan Byrd: Lucas and Fred will reluctantly agree to live there if we can fill it, Sam Rollenhagen: We need to live in that shithole of a house, Ryan Byrd: Rn guys who are down to live in pit: Byrd Soenen Johnson Theros Branch Rollenhagen., Jack Williamson: Created new poll 'pit or no pit?': https://s.groupme.com/5Di7rPp +<<groupy.object.attachments.GenericAttachment object at 0x102f4d208>>, D'Jasper Probincrux III: I think that even if we don't tailgate there it's just a better spot in general to live and plus we can fit more of the pc in that house, Sam Rollenhagen: And cause we're not it's not as good, Sam Rollenhagen: Why Fiji should be in the pit this year , JVD: I think the put is pretty pointless , Sam Rollenhagen: The pit , Mike Johnson: Bring back the pit, Mike Johnson: Fuck you, Rocket Man: We have no need to live in that shithole of a house, Rocket Man: People should live in apartments/the house , Fred Eder: Why?

Houser is going to talk with chef joe and make sure that guys living in geddes house can get an in-house meal plan. Also, as an incentive to get guys to step up and save Fiji, guys who live in the Geddes house will have a substantial cut in dues (at least half). If we get 7 guys to fill this house, you'll each pay $700 for rent for 12 months plus around 30/mo for utilities, and you'll also have the ability to sublet over spring term which you cannot due living in the house. That's substantially cheaper than living at 707, not to mention you wont be paying as much for dues. We are not on sopro, which means we can have SRC monitored parties at this house.

But we need at least 5 people to live there for it to be financially possible, Ayatollah Khomeini: Do we need it to be at full capacity or can we have some people live there to offset cost and then have everyone chip in as part of dues to pay for rest, Ryan Byrd: You literally could not have more than a 10 person pregame there at the largest. We won't be able to use their house for anything, Ryan Byrd: Honestly none of that matters tho. This house isn't an option it's a necessity.

The 100% wrong thing to do one week after that event is to ask for an exception to a rule, which is the alcohol exemption. We can have that meeting later once this is cleared up, but it would be a terrible idea to ask for that rn. , Jon Theros: whatever i'm wrong , Jon Theros: "no official consequences except for a dry house next year", CJ Ramsdell: He's gotta a point tho if we don't file for alc exemption now, when would we be able to? , Ryan Byrd: We could be a dry house.
